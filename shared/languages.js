                    <li><strong>50% of your bonus</strong> depends on your accuracy in the crucial three first trials after the visual 2-back.
                    <br>In the example above, this means correctly identifying that the <span class="highlight">M</span> but not the <span class="highlight">B</span> or <span class="highlight">Q</span> matches the <span class="highlight">M</span> before before the visual task.</li>
                    <li><strong>25% of your bonus</strong> depends on your accuracy in the visual 2-back trials.</li>
                    <li><strong>25% of your bonus</strong> depends on your accuracy in the remaining letter 3-back trials.</li>

                - 50% accuracy in letter 3-back<br>
                Your bonus would be: __PAYMENT__€ × (0.5 × 1.0 + 0.25 × 0.5 + 0.25 × 0.5) = __PAYMENT__€ × 0.75</p>

                💡 Remember: The most important thing to maximize your bonus is to identify, after each visual 2-back, whether the first three letters of the letter 3-back respectively match the last three letters you saw before the visual 2-back!

                    💡 À retenir: l’élément le plus important pour maximiser votre bonus est d’identifier, après chaque 2-back visuel, si les trois premières lettres du 3-back lettres correspondent respectivement aux trois dernières lettres que vous avez vues avant le 2-back visuel !
